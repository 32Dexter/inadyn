Inadyn is a simple and small DDNS client written in the C language.  DDNS is a popular
service for Internet users with dynamically allocated IP addresses.

If your ISP provides you with a DHCP or PPPoE/PPPoA connection you risk losing your
IP address every time you reconnect, or in DHCP even when the lease is renegotiated.

By using a DDNS client such as inadyn you can register an Internet name at certain
providers that the DDNS client updates, periodically and/or on demand when your IP
changes.

Inadyn can maintain multiple host names with the same IP address, and has a web based
IP detection which runs well behind a NAT router.

Common DDNS service providers:

       http://www.dyndns.org
       http://freedns.afraid.org
       http://www.zoneedit.com
       http://www.no-ip.com

Some of these services are free of charge for non-commercial use, others take a small
fee, but also provide more domains to chose from.
