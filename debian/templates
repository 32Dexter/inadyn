Template: inadyn/advanced
Type: bool
Default: false
Description: Do you want help creating your /etc/inadyn.conf?
 Answering yes will give you a series of questions that help you create
 a basic /etc/inadyn.conf
 .
 Most users can safely answer Yes here.  When inadyn is upgraded
 next time, you will be asked again for your password, this is
 merely because of safety reasons, since it is not stored in the
 Debconf db, only in /etc/inadyn.conf
 .
 If you have an advanced setup, answer No and you can safely edit
 /etc/inadyn.conf with the help of the man pages, without having
 to worry about future upgrades of the package.

Template: inadyn/provider
Type: select
Choices: Dyn, FreeDNS, Loopia, nsupdate, duckdns, no-ip.com, dynv6.com, tunnelbroker
Default: FreeDNS
Description: Select your DDNS provider
 This is just a selection of all the DDNS providers Inadyn supports.  If
 you cannot find your provider in this list, select one and then edit
 the /etc/inadyn.conf file by hand to set up a custom one.
 .
 See the man page for inadyn(8) and inadyn.conf(5) for more information.

Template: inadyn/username
Type: string
Description: Your username at the DDNS provider

Template: inadyn/password
Type: password
Description: Your password at the DDNS provider
 When Inadyn has been (re)configured the password is removed from
 the debconf db, but it will be visible from /etc/inadyn.conf for
 anyone with root access.

Template: inadyn/hostname
Type: string
Description: Your hostname, or similar, at the DDNS provider
 For some providers, most notably Tunnelbroker, the hostname must be
 an 'update-key', or similar, and not the actual hostname.
 .
 For most use-cases, however, the hostname is something like this:
 hostname.provider.tla
 .
 If you want to update more than one record at the same provider, please
 run `dpkg-reconfigure inadyn` and select Advanced mode when done with
 this first pass.  You can then safely edit /etc/inadyn.conf as you want.
